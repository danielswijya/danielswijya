## 👋Hello There, this is Daniel

👋 @danielswijya

I’m a tech nerd who just graduated and likes building things that *actually do stuff*.  
I bounce between software, product, data, and systems — usually wherever the problem gets interesting.

---

### 🧠 brain currently occupied with
- building full-stack apps from scratch
- product thinking + system design
- data pipelines, dashboards, and visualizations
- figuring out how messy real-world workflows *should* work

---

### 🧪 stuff I’ve worked on
- 🧩 platforms for students & nonprofits  
- 🗺️ data + map-based dashboards (health / research)
- 🛠️ internal tools that make teams less confused
- 🤖 experiments with n8n automation & AI workflows
- 🍓 tinker with Raspberry Pi

<sub>I care more about *why* a tool is used than flexing how many I know.</sub>

---

### 🎮 dev vibes
- I like clean systems, but I ship before they’re perfect
- I enjoy debugging *why* something feels wrong, not just fixing errors
- I’m usually the person asking “wait… does this actually make sense?”

---

### 🤝 down to collaborate on
- interesting side projects
- early-stage product ideas
- tools that help people work better
- anything that sits between tech + real users

### 🎷 bonus lore
